Name: Alejandro Martinez

Description: My research interests, described above, are well-aligned with two of CITRISâ€™ initiatives: sustainable infrastructure and people and robots.My research on bioinspired processes, in collaboration with experts in biology and robotics, focuses on the development of robots with enhanced capabilities to improve the efficiency and sustainability of construction practices. My research on natural and human-made hazard risk assessment focuses on the characterization of the ground conditions in urban and non-urban sites with the objective of enhancing the ability of engineers to assess the consequence of geologic hazards. Lastly, the goal of my research with 3D printing is to develop enhanced designs of infrastructure systems that can lead to more sustainable practices.
