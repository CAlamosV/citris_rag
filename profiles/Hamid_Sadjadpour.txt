Name: Hamid Sadjadpour

Description: Hamid Sadjadpour received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis on communication theory from University of Southern California (USC) in 1996. During his Ph.D., he worked part-time at Lincom corporations between February 1994 and July 1995 as a member of technical staff. During this period, he worked on the design of communication systems for satellite applications. Since December 1995, he was with AT&T research Lab as a senior technical staff member. He was promoted to Principal technical staff member in 2000. During this time, he worked on the design of a new full-duplex DSL modem. One of his joint work in bit loading algorithm with NEXT and FEXT minimization capability has been accepted in T1E1.4 US standard for the next generation of DSL modems. He has also designed a Multi-tone Turbo TCM (MTTCM) technique for DSL modems and participated in development of the first DSL modem with Turbo code capability. In the fall of 2001, he joined the department of Electrical Engineering at University of California, Santa Cruz as an assistant professor where he is currently employed.Professor Sadjadpour works with Communications, Signal Processing, and Networking groups where his research interests are in the areas of scaling laws and fundamental limits of wireless networks, performance analysis of protocols in sensor and ad hoc networks, coding and signal processing for DSL applications and data storage systems. He is also a member of UCSC Broadband Communications (UCBC) research, CCRG, and SSRC research groups.
