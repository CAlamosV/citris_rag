Name: Dan Garcia

Description: Dan Garcia is a Teaching Professor (aka Senior Lecturer with Security Of Employment) in the Computer Science Division of the EECS Department at the University of California, Berkeley, and joined the faculty in the fall of 2000. Dan received his PhD and MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2000 and 1995, and dual BS degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1990. He was chosen as an ACM Distinguished Educator in 2012.He is active participant in SIGCSE (having presented every year since 2001), and is currently working with the Ensemble computing portal and ICSI Teaching Privacy research projects. He serves on the ACM Education Board, the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles Development Committee, is the faculty champion for the local CSTA chapter, and the faculty co-director for BFOIT, a wonderful Berkeley K-12 outreach effort.He has won all four of the department’s teaching awards:* the Information Technology Faculty Award for Excellence inUndergraduate Teaching in 2004* the Diane S. McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2002,* the EECS outstanding graduate student instructor award in 1998, and* the CS outstanding graduate student instructor award in 1992.He was also chosen as a UC Berkeley “Unsung Hero” in 2005. He holds the record for the highest teaching effectiveness ratings (6.7/7) in the history of the department’s lower-division introductory courses.He has taught (or co-taught) courses in teaching techniques, computer graphics, virtual reality, computer animation, self-paced programming as well as the lower-division introductory curriculum. He is currently mentoring over seventy undergraduates spread across four groups he founded in 2001 centered around his research, art and development interests in computer graphics, Macintosh OS X programming, computational game theory and computer science education. He recently co-developed a computing course for allfreshman engineers, as well as a full course renovation of the venerable introductory computing course for non-majors, “CS10 : The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)”. This redesign earned a “Bears Breaking Boundaries” curriculum design award, a Lockheed Martin broadening participation grant, and was chosen as one of five national pilots for the new Advanced Placement Computer Science : Principles course. Thanks to three NSF grants, they are working to offer professional development to 500 high school teachers across the country, and are helping to build an online community of practice for all teachers in the CS10K project.On the fun side, he can dance DDR level 7, play the harmonica, juggle 5 balls, score in the low 90s on the links, spin things on his finger and knows all the words to many old-school raps, stand-up comedy bits and Monty Python sketches. He also has a collection of several hundred game and puzzle books, and terribly enjoys sharing good brain teasers or playing any one of his many exotic board games with students who drop by during open office hours. Don’t get him started telling jokes…His wife Tao is also a UC Berkeley Computer Science alumni, and is a Principal Scientist at Pandora Media. They have two young children.

( short biography , curriculum vitæ ) I'm a Teaching Professor (aka Senior Lecturer SOE )
in the Computer Science division
of the EECS department at the University of
California, Berkeley . 
I graduated with a Ph.D. from the same department in May 2000,
where I worked with the OPTICAL project doing Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization. On the personal side, I'm married to the
beautiful and brilliant Tao Ye and have two wonderful kids. Teaching In the Fall of 2024, I'll be 
teaching CS10, the Beauty and Joy of Computing , co-teaching (with my awesome colleague Justin Yokota ) 

 our sophomore-level computer architecture course: CS61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (formerly Machine Structures ) . and co-teaching CS194-244 (EECS Star Assessments for Mastery Learning) with Armando Fox and Narges Norouzi . We
(co-PIs Emeritus Teaching
Prof Brian Harvey and Prof Tiffany
Barnes of NC State ) have
trained over 1,000 high school teachers in
the AP
CS Principles version of
the Beauty and Joy of Computing course using the awesome Snap!
(Build Your Own Blocks) graphical programming environment and
the Blown to Bits book. Service I'm deeply interested and active in computer science education, having presented at the SIGCSE annual conference every year since 2001 , and was honored to be chosen as an ACM Distinguished Educator in 2012, ACM Distinguished Speaker 2019-2025, SIGCSE Vice-Chair 2019-2022, SIGCSE Secretary 2022-2025, and CRA-WP Board member 2023-2026.

I was humbled to be chosen (with my friend Prof Tiffany Barnes ) as the program co-chair for SIGCSE 2017 and symposium co-chair for SIGCSE 2018 in Baltimore, MD .

I was co-guest-editor
(with Moti
Ben-Ari and Tom
Murphy ) of the TOCE
journal Special
Issue on Concurrent, Parallel and Distributed
Computation , served on
the GRE
Computer Science Committee, and
the Ensemble NSF project
to create a website for computing educators.


I recently served on the CRA Task Force on Teaching-Track Faculty , the ACM
Education Council ,
the College
Board's AP Computer Science:
Principles development committee , TEALS Advisory Board , SRI's PACT Advisory Board , SMASH's Advisory Board , and CS PCK's Advisory Board .

Locally, I have been the Faculty Supervisor for our 11 summer classes, charged with hiring and nurturing the best instructors to cover our summer courses. Finally, I was the higher education co-chair for CSforCA (CA advocacy for computer science) from 2019-2022, and I do everything I can to help our local CSTA chapter (CA-Golden Gate) thrive through monthly (ish) meetings I help facilitate on campus (and running CS4HS workshops in the summertime). Active RAD ( Research , Art & Development) Student Groups and Projects I'm quite enthusiastic about the RAD (research, art & development) groups I advise. If you're interested in joining one of these groups (shown below), check their schedules for times and locations.
