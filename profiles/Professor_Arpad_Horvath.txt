Name: Professor Arpad Horvath

Description: Arpad Horvath is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley (http://faculty.ce.berkeley.edu/horvath/), Head of the Energy, Civil Infrastructure and Climate Graduate Program, Director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center, and Director of the Engineering and Business for Sustainability certificate program (http://sustainable-engineering.berkeley.edu).His research focuses on life-cycle environmental and economic assessment of products, processes, and services, particularly answering important questions posed about civil infrastructure systems and the built environment. He has conducted studies on the environmental implications of various products, processes and services, in particular, transportation systems, water and wastewater systems, biofuels, pavements, buildings, and construction materials.Professor Horvath was a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Science Advisory Board (Environmental Engineering Committee) between 2010 and 2015 and a member of the Science Advisory Board’s Scientific and Technological Achievement Awards Committee between 2011 and 2016.He is an Associate Editor of theJournal of Infrastructure Systems,Executive Board member ofEnvironmental Research Letters,editorial advisory board member ofEnvironmental Science & TechnologyandJournal of Industrial Ecology.He was a Council Member of the International Society for Industrial Ecology between 2014 and 2016. He is a frequent consultant to industry and government agencies.Arpad Horvath is an author of 95 peer-reviewed journal papers. Among several conference organizational roles, he was Conference Chair of the 6th International Conference on Industrial Ecology in 2011, the world’s largest conference in sustainability research to that date.Arpad Horvath is a recipient of the International Society for Industrial Ecology’s Laudise Prize, the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Huber Civil Engineering Research Prize, the UC Berkeley Chancellor’s Sustainability Award, and the Excellence in Review Award fromEnvironmental Science & Technology. Three of his papers have been voted into the top three papers inEnvironmental Science & Technologyin 2008, 2011, and 2012.
