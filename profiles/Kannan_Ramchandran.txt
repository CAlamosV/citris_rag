Name: Kannan Ramchandran

Description: Kannan Ramchandran (Ph.D.: Columbia University, 1993) is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where he has been since 1999. He was on the faculty at UIUC from 1993 to 1999, and with AT&T Bell Labs from 1984 to 1990.Prof. Ramchandran is a Fellow of the IEEE. He has published extensively in his field, holds over a dozen patents, and has received several awards for his research and teaching including an IEEE Information Theory Society and Communication Society Joint Best Paper award for 2012, an IEEE Communication Society Data Storage Best Paper award in 2010, two Best Paper awards from the IEEE Signal Processing Society in 1993 and 1999, an Okawa Foundation Prize for outstanding research at Berkeley in 2001, and an Outstanding Teaching Award at Berkeley in 2009, and a Hank Magnuski Scholar award at Illinois in 1998.His research interests are broadly in the area of distributed systems theory and algorithms intersecting the fields of signal processing, communications, coding and information theory, and networking. His current systems focus is on large-scale distributed storage, large-scale collaborative video content delivery, and biological systems, with research challenges including latency, privacy and security, remote synchronization, sparse sampling, and shotgun genome sequencing.
