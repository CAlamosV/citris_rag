Name: Louise Mozingo

Description: Professor Mozingo received her Master in Landscape Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, and undergraduate degrees in Biology and Art History from the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia. A former associate and senior landscape architect for Sasaki Associates, Professor Mozingo joined the Department of Landscape Architecture & Environmental Planning after a decade of professional practice, managing a range of master planning and design projects.Professor Mozingo’s research and creative work focuses on ecological design, landscape history, and social processes in public landscapes. Landscape architectural research usually considers ecology, history, and social factors separately; the purpose of Professor Mozingo’s scholarship is to breach the intellectual boundaries between them to produce a synthetic critical perspective of landscape architecture as a complex cultural artifact. Her particular concern is the planning and design of collective and public open spaces that produce both ecological and social sustainability, and thrive to support civil society in an increasingly multi-cultural world. Her research contributes to landscape architectural scholarship, as well as to a profession eager for discernment and insight.Professor Mozingo has been the recipient of Harvard University’s Dumbarton Oaks Fellowship for Studies in Landscape Architecture, the Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture Award of Recognition for Excellence in Teaching, Writing, and Service, and the University of California, Berkeley Chancellor’s Award of Recognition for University and Community Partnerships.Professor Mozingo’s articles and reviews have appeared in Places, Landscape Journal, Journal of the History of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, Landscape Architecture Magazine, Geographical Review, and the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. She has contributed chapters to Everyday America; Cultural Landscape Studies after J.B. Jackson (2003), edited by Chris Wilson and Paul Groth and the forthcoming Healing Natures, edited by Robert France.
