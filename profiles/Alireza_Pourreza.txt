Name: Alireza Pourreza

Description: My research interests include agricultural mechanization, robotics, sensors, computer vision, and GIS. My research goals are to answer fundamental questions using intelligent systems theory in high-impact applications–such as cooperative robotic systems with respect to sensing, estimation, and control. I am building a research program that is inspired by cutting-edge knowledge and will have a long-term impact on the technological development of agriculture and food industries through progress in the areas of automation, mechanization, site-specific crop management, smart sensing. My research program is well-aligned with the CITRIS mission.Research interests: Sensing Agricultural Automation, Precision Agriculture, Big Data
