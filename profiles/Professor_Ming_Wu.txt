Name: Professor Ming Wu

Description: Dr. Ming Wu is Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, and Co-Director of Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC). His research interests include optical MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems), optoelectronics, and biophotonics.Professor Wu received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley in 1985 and 1988, respectively. From 1988 to 1992, he was a Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, New Jersey. From 1992 to 2004, he was a professor in the electrical engineering department at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he also served as Vice Chair for Industrial Affiliate Program and Director of Nanoelectronics Research Facility. In 2004, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley.He has published six book chapters, over 140 journal papers and 290 conference papers. He is the holder of 15 U.S. patents. Prof. Wu is a Fellow of IEEE, and a member of Optical Society of America. He was a Packard Foundation Fellow from 1992 to 1997. He is the founding Co-Chair of IEEE/LEOS Summer Topical Meeting on Optical MEMS (1996), the predecessor of IEEE/LEOS International Conference on Optical MEMS. He has served in the program committees of many technical conferences, including MEMS, OFC, CLEO, LEOS, MWP, IEDM, DRC, ISSCC; and as Guest Editor of two special issues of IEEE journals on Optical MEMS.

                          video demonstration) Ming Wu's group has recently developed a new image-driven optical manipulation tool called “ optoelectronic tweezers ”. Using light-induced dielectrophoresis on a photoconductor, virtual electrode pattern is generated by projecting an LED light through a DMD spatial light modulator. A single LED is capable of generating more than 15,000 individually addressable traps. The results was published in the July 21 issue of Nature titled, " Massively Parallel Manipulation of Single Cells and Microparticles Using Optical Images (PDF) " ( online version ).
