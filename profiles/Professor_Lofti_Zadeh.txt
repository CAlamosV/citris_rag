Name: Professor Lofti Zadeh

Description: The basic ideas underlying soft computing in current incarnation have links to many earlier influences, among them Prof. Zadeh’s 1965 paper on fuzzy sets; the 1973 paper on the analysis of complex systems and decision processes; and the 1979 report (1981 paper) on possibility theory and soft data analysis.BISC Program is the world-leading center for basic and applied research in soft computing. The principal constituents of soft computing (SC) are fuzzy logic (FL), neural network theory (NN) and probabilistic reasoning (PR), with the latter subsuming belief networks, evolutionary computing including DNA computing, chaos theory and parts of learning theory. Some of the most striking achievements of BISC Program are: fuzzy reasoning (set and logic), new soft computing algorithms making intelligent, semi-unsupervised use of large quantities of complex data, uncertainty analysis, perception-based decision analysis and decision support systems for risk analysis and management, computing with words, computational theory of perception (CTP), and precisiated natural language (PNL).

He also e served as the Director of BISC (Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing).  Lotfi Zadeh passed away on September 6, 2017. Zadeh was an alumnus of the University of Tehran, MIT and Columbia University. From 1950 to 1959, he was a member of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University. He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at UC Berkeley in 1959 and served as its Chair from 1963 to 1968. During his tenure as Chair, he played a key role in changing the name of the Department from EE to EECS.  He held visiting appointments at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ; MIT, Cambridge, MA; IBM Research Laboratory, San Jose, CA; AI Center, SRI International, Menlo Park, CA; and the Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University.
