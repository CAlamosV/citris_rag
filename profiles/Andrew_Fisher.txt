Name: Andrew Fisher

Description: My research focuses on physical and chemical hydrogeology on land and below the seafloor. My research group and colleagues have completed projects focusing on groundwater recharge, surface water – groundwater interactions, the upper oceanic crust at seafloor spreading centers and on ridge flanks, heat flow below the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and numerous additional problems. We use mapping, seismic, borehole, and thermal data, measure seepage fluxes, collect and analyze water and soil samples, and simulate hydrologic processes using numerical and analytical models.Recent highlights include: (1) development of numerous projects involving the influence of environmental change on groundwater and surface water systems, including establishment ofThe Recharge Initiativeand theUC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative(UC WASSRI, aka, UC Water); (2) a successfull first phase and renewal for the second phase of an NSF Science and Technology Center, theCenter for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations(C-DEBI), (3) development of novel tools and the first successful measurements of the heat flux into the base of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, as part of theWISSARDproject. These and other projects include field work, laboratory analyses, and modeling.
