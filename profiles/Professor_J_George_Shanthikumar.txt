Name: Professor J. George Shanthikumar

Description: I work mainly on the design, analysis and control of stochastic systems such as communication and manufacturing systems. However, a good part of my effort is directed towards developing methodologies to simplify these tasks.J. George Shanthikumar, Ph.D is a professor of industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Shanthikumar served as consultant for KLA-Tencor Corp., and worked on joint development projects with AMD, IBM, Intel, LSI, Motorola, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, Fujitsu, TSMC and UMC. He serves as Member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Intermolecular, Inc. He is a co-editor ofFlexible Services & Manufacturing Journal, and he has served on numerous editorial boards of technical journals. He has authored or coauthored more than 250 papers and has coauthored three books,Stochastic Models Of Manufacturing Systems,Stochastic Orders And Their Applications, andStochastic Orders.
