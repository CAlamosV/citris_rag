Bionic Engineering and Assistive Robotics Laboratory (BEAR) The UC Davis BEAR Lab is an interdisciplinary engineering lab that aims to promote the integration of humans and advanced assistive technologies. We seek to understand how human actions may differ from cooperative actions with machines. We employ techniques that leverage neural rewiring surgeries, advanced mechatronic control, and sensory feedback devices to blur the line between man and machine as we strive to facilitate their seamless cooperation.
