Polytechnic State University in 1987, and M.S. and
Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1990
and 1999 respectively. From 1987–89, he served as a new product engineer working on the processor for 
a high-end minicomputer in Hewlett Packard's Computer Systems Division, 
Cupertino, CA.
In early 1999, he joined 
Atheros Communications
[ wikipedia ]
as the second full-time employee after the founders and served as a core
member of the team which developed the first IEEE 802.11a (54 Mbps,
5 GHz) Wi-Fi wireless LAN solution. The chipset began shipping
in volume in September of 2001 and for one and a half years was the
only shipping 802.11a
chipset [ ISSCC 2002 ].  
Atheros became a publicly-held company in Feb. of 2004 and was purchased
by Qualcomm in 2011.

In 2003, Dr. Baas joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the University of California, Davis as an Assistant Professor.
He became an Associate Professor in 2008, and a full Professor in 2015. Dr. Baas has published over 100 peer-reviewed papers in the areas of
algorithms, applications, architectures, arithmetic, circuits, VLSI design,
and software tools for high-performance, energy-efficient, and area-efficient
computation with consideration of the challenges and opportunities of
future fabrication technologies.  He is interested in both programmable and
special-purpose processors with an emphasis on DSP, neural network,
multimedia, and embedded workloads with recent projects targeting datacenter
and scientific workloads.  Projects include the AsAP (Asynchronous Array of simple Processors) programmable array processor
chips 
( 36 processors , 167 processors , 1000 
processors ), 
applications, and tools;
Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoders; 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processors; 
viterbi decoders; 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) ciphers;
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR);
H.264 video codecs;
Display Stream Compression (DSC) codecs;
sorting and string-search engines;
and 
machine learning engines.
His group is one of very few university groups in the world that
design and fabricate programmable (and configurable special-purpose)
processor chips.  They have designed what are believed to be the #1 and #2 highest 
clock rate fabricated processors ever designed in a university ,
and among the largest deep-submicron CMOS chips ever designed in a university. Dr. Baas was a National Science Foundation Fellow from 1990–93 and a
NASA Graduate Student Researcher Fellow from 1993–96.
He received the National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2006, 
  Best Paper Award at 
    the IEEE International Conference on Computer Design 2011, Best Student Paper Award third place at IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems 2015, Best Student Paper Award third place at IEEE Asilomar 2014, "WACIest" Best-In-Session Paper at ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2010, and
  Best Paper nominations at IEEE Asilomar 2011 and IEEE BioCAS 2010. He supervised the research that earned the College of Engineering Zuhair A. 
    Munir Award for Best Doctoral Dissertation Honorable Mention in 2013, and 
  was awarded the Most Promising Engineer/Scientist Award by AISES in 2006. From 2016–19 he was an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II . From 2016–19 he was an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems . From 2007–12 he was an Associate Editor for the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits .
