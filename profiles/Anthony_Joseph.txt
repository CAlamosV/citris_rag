Name: Anthony Joseph

Description: Dr. Joseph received his S.B. and S.M. degrees in EECS in 1988 and his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in 1998, all from MIT. He has been on the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley since 1998, holding the Chancellor’s Associate Professor Chair since 2007. Starting in June, he will be the director of the Intel Research Berkeley Laboratory.His research interests include network and computer security, the security of machine learning in decision-making environments, critical cyber-infrastructure protection, mobile computing and networking, wireless telecommunication networks, overlay networks, and computer architectures for distributed systems.Dr. Joseph is a recipient of the Diane McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching, a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, an Okawa Foundation Research Grant in Telecommunications and Information Processing, an IBM Faculty Development Award, an Intel Foundation Graduate Fellowship, an IBM Corporation Graduate Fellowship, and a Shell Corporation National Achievement Corporation Scholarship. He is a lifetime member of ACM, and also a member of USENIX, IEEE, and Sigma Xi.He has already served ACM in multiple roles: past associate editor for ACM SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communications Review; past technical program co-chair for the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom 2003); past editorial board member for ACM/Kluwer Wireless Networks journal; past general chair for the Workshop on Mobile Computing Services and Applications 2006 (co-sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE); past member of the Defense Science Study Group (2004-2005).
