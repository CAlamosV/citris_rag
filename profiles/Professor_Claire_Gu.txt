Name: Professor Claire Gu

Description: Claire Gu’s research interests include fiber optics, holographic data storage, liquid crystal displays, nonlinear optics, and optical information processing; with a current emphasis on fiber sensors using SERS (surface enhanced Raman scattering). She has published more than 180 journal and conference papers in these areas. In addition, she has co-authored a text/reference book on “Optics of Liquid Crystal Displays”, and co-edited two technical books on photorefractive nonlinear optics and applications. She received a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award in 1993. From 2000 to 2006, she served as a Topical Editor of Optics Letters. In 2007, she has been elected a Fellow of SPIE (The International Society of Optical Engineering).
