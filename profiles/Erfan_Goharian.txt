Name: Erfan Goharian

Description: My research interests centered on understanding the dynamics of water, energy, and food (WEF) systems OR coupled human-natural systems, specifically using resilience thinking, system analysis, integrated modeling and management, hydroinformatics, and climate change impact assessment. I always search for holistic solutions, trans-disciplinary collaborations, and inclusive participatory modeling techniques to extend individual management of environmental systems to a whole climate-water-energy-food nexus research and practice.I always search for holistic solutions, trans-disciplinary collaborations, and inclusive participatory modeling techniques to extend individual management of environmental systems to a whole climate-water-energy-food nexus research and practice.
