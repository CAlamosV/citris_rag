Name: Tsu-Jae King Liu

Description: Tsu-Jae King Liu received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. She joined the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center as a Member of Research Staff in 1992, to research and develop high-performance thin-film transistor technologies for flat-panel display applications. In 1996 she joined the faculty of the University of California, at Berkeley, where she now holds the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) Distinguished Professorship in Microelectronics. From 2000 to 2004 and from 2006 to 2008, she served as the Faculty Director of the UC Berkeley Microfabrication Laboratory. From July 2004 through June 2006 she was Senior Director of Engineering in the Advanced Technology Group of Synopsys, Inc. (Mountain View, CA). From 2008 through 2012, Professor Liu was the Associate Dean for Research in the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley. She also served as Faculty Director of the UC Berkeley Marvell Nanofabrication Laboratory in 2012. From 2012 to 2016 she served as Chair of the Electrical Engineering Division, and from 2014 to 2016 she served as Chair of the EECS Department.Professor Liuâ€™s awards include the Ross M. Tucker AIME Electronics Materials Award (1992) for seminal work in polycrystalline silicon-germanium thin films; an NSF CAREER Award (1998) for research in thin-film transistor technology; the DARPA Significant Technical Achievement Award (2000) for development of the FinFET; the Electrical Engineering Award for Outstanding Teaching at UC Berkeley (2003); the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award (2010) for contributions to nanoscale MOS transistors, memory devices, and MEMS devices; the UC Berkeley Faculty Mentor Award (2010); the Electrochemical Society Dielectric Science and Technology Division Thomas D. Callinan Award (2011) for excellence in dielectrics and insulation investigations; the Intel Outstanding Researcher in Nanotechnology Award (2012); the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) University Researcher Award (2014); and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) Aristotle Award (2016). Her research activities are presently in advanced materials, fabrication processes and devices for energy-efficient electronics. She has authored or co-authored over 500 publications and holds over 90 patents.Professor Liu is a Fellow of the IEEE and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, and serves on the Board of Directors for Intel Corporation.
