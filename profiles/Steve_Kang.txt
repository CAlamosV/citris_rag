From August 1985 to December 2000, he was Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Research Professor of Coordinated Science Laboratory and Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was named the first Charles Marshall Senior University Scholar, an Associate in the Center for Advanced Study, and has served as the Founding Director of Center for ASIC Research and Development, and Associate Director of NSF Engineering Research Center for Compound Semiconductor Microelectronic at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was a Visiting Professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Lausanne in 1989, at the University of Karlsruhe in 1997 and at the Technical University of Munich in 1998.Until 1985 he was with AT&T Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill and Holmdel, and also served as a faculty member of Rutgers University. He led the development of world’s first full 32-bit CMOS microprocessor chips and their peripheral chips as supervisor of high-end microprocessor design group. These chips were manufactured for AT&T’s high-end switching machines such as 3B5 and 3B20 and also AT&T computers. For his outstanding leadership in both development and later manufacturing of these chips, he was awarded an exceptional contribution award. In early phase of his Bell Labs career, he designed satellite-based private networks using statistical traffic analysis and nonlinear optimization.
