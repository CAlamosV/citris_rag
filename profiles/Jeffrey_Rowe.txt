Name: Jeffrey Rowe

Description: Dr. Rowe obtained his Ph.D. from UC Davis in 1996 in Particle Physics. Since joining the Computer Security Laboratory, he has developed several algorithms for responding to network attacks. He was leader of the team testing and maintaining the GrIDS system. He also led the team subcontracted to produce the IDIP Discovery Coordinator for the Boeing Automated Response to Intrusions project. Most recently, Dr. Rowe evaluated GrIDS under the DARPA sponsored Lincoln Lab IDS evaluation program. His research interests include architectures for very large-scale IDS systems, use of correlation techniques in Intrusion Detection and automatic response methodologies. Jeff conducts research with Professor Karl Levitt in the Computer Security Laboratory.

						in cyber-security. My main focus has traditionally been upon run-time security 						monitoring including intrusion detection, large-scale monitoring architectures and 
						adaptive response and defenses. Past research topics have included, Spreading malware detection and defense (Internet worms). Resilient system design. Artificial diversity to break monoculture vulnerabilities. Control theoretic approaches to adaptive defense. Security testing and evaluation. Currently I have the following active research projects underway. Social networks for security. Argumentation logic for reasoning about cyber-security. Security for critical-infrastructures. Securing the next-generation SmartGrid. Cyber-physical system security. Diagnosis-based intrusion detection. Curriculum Vitae Download Complete CV Publications B. Copos, K. Levitt, J. Rowe, P.
