Name: Soraya Murray

Description: Soraya Murray is an interdisciplinary scholar focusing on contemporary visual culture, with particular interest in new media, cultural studies, and globalization in the arts.  Her writings have been published in Art Journal, Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art, Flash Art, and PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art.  She is also a regular contributor to the international contemporary art journal ExitEXPRESS (Spain).  She began teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2007.Murray’s scholarship seeks to unearth the ways that a global phenomenon of electronic mass media and communications technologies shapes human interactions and interpenetrates contemporary experience.  How do race, nation, class, gender, and access affect who may share in this experience?  How do the technologies that we have fashioned, in turn, refashion us?  In her analysis of photography, film, video, electronics, and the digital, Murray seeks to illuminate these technological expressions within the social, theoretical, and historical contexts from which they arise.

Intersectional approaches to race, nation gender, and sexuality in visual representation. Research Interests: Professor Soraya Murray is an interdisciplinary scholar of visual culture, with particular interest in contemporary art, film and video games. Murray holds a Ph.D. in art history and visual studies from Cornell University. An Associate Professor in the Film & Digital Media Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Murray studies technological representations (such as the playable simulations of video games), as well as the representations of  advanced technology, science and innovation in film and visual culture. Murray's writings are published in The Journal of Cinema and Media Studies , Critical Inquiry , Film Quarterly , Art Journal , Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art , CTheory , Public Art Review , Third Text , ROMchip , PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art , and the European Journal of American Studies . Her writings are anthologized nationally and internationally. Most recently, she has contributed to: Visual Culture Approaches to the Selfie (Routledge, 2021); The Cambridge Companion to Nineteen Eighty-Four (Cambridge U. Press, 2020), How to Play Video Games (NYU Press, 2019); and Through the Black Mirror: Deconstructing the Side Effects of the Digital Age (Palgrave, 2019). Her two anthologized essays on the military game genre, gender and race may be found in Gaming Representation: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Video Games (Indiana University Press, 2017) and in Zones of Control: Perspectives on Wargaming (The MIT Press, 2016). Her exploration of video games, genre and political affect was recently published in Red Dead Redemption: History, Myth, and Violence in the Video Game West (Oklahoma U. Press, 2023). Murray's first book, On Video Games: The Visual Politics of Race, Gender and Space (I.B. Tauris, 2018), focuses on post-9/11 era mainstream games and considers how they both mirror and are constitutive of larger societal fears, dreams, hopes and even complex struggles for recognition. In February 2021, On Video Games was republished in paperback. Murray is currently co-editing an anthology on antiracist futures in video games and play, and a single-author book on technological imaginaries in contemporary film and visual culture. www.sorayamurray.com In 2017, my course, Video Games as Visual Culture was selected for the annual Arts Dean's Lecture Series.
