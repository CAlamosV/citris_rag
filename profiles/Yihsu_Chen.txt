Name: Yihsu Chen

Description: My research focuses on studying the interactions of environmental policies and polluting industry activities. In particular, I am interested in the responses of industry (e.g., electricity) to the market-based instruments (e.g., emissions trading programs). The recent development of climate policies in northeast states RGGI (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative), California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32) and European Union ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) and Western Climate Initiative (WCI) has shown that emissions trading will continue being an area subject to policy debates.My recent ongoing research includes collaborative projects with researchers from the Iowa State University, Purdue University, University of California, Berkeley, University of New South Wales, National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Japan.Aside from economic analysis, I am also interested in public health related to air pollution. The recent research papers include quantifying the health benefit of high-speed rails and metropolitan subway systems in the developing countries.I am developing an interdisciplinary research group here at the UCM focusing on energy and environment. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions or are interested in knowing more about my research.
