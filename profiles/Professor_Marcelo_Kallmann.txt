Name: Professor Marcelo Kallmann

Description: Marcelo Kallmann is Assistant Professor and Founding Faculty at the University of California, Merced. He is also affiliated as adjunct faculty to the University of Southern California (USC), where he was working on Autonomous Virtual Humans at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). Before that he did postdocs at the USC Robotics Lab and at the Virtual Reality Lab of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), where he completed his Ph.D. in early 2001. His areas of interest include computer graphics, virtual reality, computer animation and motion planning. A significant part of his recent research has been on motion planning algorithms for handling specific needs in computer animation, games and virtual reality applications.

Personal Website Text Short: Marcelo Kallmann - UC Merced Marcelo Kallmann School of Engineering University of California, Merced Marcelo Kallmann is 
Professor and Founding Faculty 
at the University of California, Merced.
He was chair of the EECS graduate program from July 2018 to June 2020.
He holds a PhD from the Swiss Federal 
Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), was research faculty at the 
University of Southern California (USC), and a research scientist at the 
USC Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT),
before moving to UC Merced in 2005. 
A significant part of his research interests are on
motion planning algorithms for a wide range of applications in robotics 
and computer graphics.
He has served as program co-chair for the 5th International 
Conference on Motion in Games (MIG) in 2012
and as Associate Editor for ICRA in multiple years. 
He is also an Associate Editor for the Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds journal.
At UC Merced he established the computer graphics 
group (http://graphics.ucmerced.edu/). He is recipient of several NSF awards and his recent work on triangulations for path planning 
runs inside The Sims 4, the best selling PC game of 2014 and 2015. Note: I have moved to a full time position at Amazon Robotics and will not be able to work 
		with new PhD students.
