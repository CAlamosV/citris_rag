Name: Shaowei Chen

Description: Shaowei Chen finished his undergraduate studies in China in 1991 with a BS degree in Chemistry from the University of Science and Technology of China, and then went to Cornell University receiving his MS and PhD degrees in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Following a postdoctoral appointment in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he started his independent career in Southern Illinois University in 1998. In summer 2004, he moved to the University of California at Santa Cruz. He is currently a Professor of Chemistry and the Faculty Director of the UCSC COSMOS program.RESEARCH INTERESTS: Physical Chemistry, NanomaterialsThe research program in the Chen group is centered around electron transfer chemistry at the nanoscale. More specifically, we are interested in the electron transfer properties of nanometer-sized functional particles and their organized assemblies. Our strategy is to employ a series of chemical as well as physical manipulations to shed light onto the molecular origin of these unprecedented electrochemical phenomena.
