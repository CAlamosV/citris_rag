Name: David Culler

Description: Professor David Culler is former Faculty Director of the CITRIS Sustainable Infrastructures Initiative.He received his B.A. from UC Berkeley, in 1980, and a M.S. and Ph.D. from MIT, in 1985 and 1989 respectively. He joined the EECS faculty at UC Berkeley in 1989 and is the founding Director of Intel Research, UC Berkeley. Professor Culler recentlyÂ served as Chair of the Electrical Engineer and Computer Science department at UC Berkeley.He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, an ACM Fellow, and was selected in Scientific American Top 50 Researchers and Technology Review 10 Technologies that Will Change the World. He was awarded the NSF Presidential Young Investigator and the Presidential Faculty Fellowship.His research addresses networks of small, embedded wireless devices, planetary-scale internet services, parallel computer architecture, parallel programming languages, and high performance communication. This includes TinyOS, Berkeley Motes, PlanetLab, Networks of Workstations (NOW), Internet services, Active Messages, Split-C, and the Threaded Abstract Machine (TAM).
