His laboratory is interested in developing computational methods and control theory that enable learning, analysis, and predictive control of uncertain systems. These methods are employed to facilitate high-performance control of systems spanning from (bio)molecular processes to manufacturing and energy systems whose dynamics cannot be modeled accurately or are intrinsically uncertain.Biography2004, B.S., University of Tehran, Chemical Engineering2006, M.S., Delft University of Technology, Chemical Engineering2010, Ph.D., Delft University of Technology, Systems and Control2011-2012, Postdoctoral Fellow, Delft University of Technology2012-2014, Senior Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
