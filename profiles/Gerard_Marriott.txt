Name: Gerard Marriott

Description: The Marriott Lab is recognized for its innovative research programs at the interface of bioengineering, chemistry and biophysics. Its technology-driven research programs are advanced through long-standing interests in the design and synthesis of optical probes and biosensors and their application to sensing technologies and microscope imaging techniques.Notable firsts for the lab include: the introduction of time-resolved delayed luminescence imaging microscopy; rational design of synthetic and genetically-encoded optical switch probes for high-contrast in vivo imaging using OLID- and OLID-FRET; caged proteins and optical control of protein activity with high spatiotemporal resolution; genetically encoded probes for quantitative fluorescence anisotropy, FRET and lifetime-based imaging of protein interactions in living cells and model organisms; optical switch probes to reversibly control protein interactions using light; engineering human platelets and exosomes as living vehicles for long-term, in vivo imaging of early-stage tumours, and targeted release of drugs to manage tumours; a new concept in the design of drug-releasing contact lenses that slowly release timolol and Xiidra during passive exposures to natural daylight; and the design of ELISAs for point-of-care diagnostic devices.Highlights of recentresearch publicationsinclude:Mechanoluminescent sensors, fluorescent probes and actuators (2015,2020,2021)Piezoelectric crystals for in vivo imaging of stress distributions in load-bearing devices (2020)Engineering human platelets and exosomes for in vivo imaging and drug delivery (2016,2021)Daylight-triggered drug release from contact lenses (2019,2021)New ELISA-based platforms for POC diagnostics (2020)Design of NIR-I and NIR-II probes for in vivo imaging (2017,2020)Gerard Marriott received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1987, where his research advisor was Gregorio Weber.
