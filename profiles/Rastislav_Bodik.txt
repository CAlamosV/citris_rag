Name: Rastislav Bodik

Description: Ras Bodik is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He joined the faculty in 2002. Before that, he taught at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh (1999), and his Diploma from the Technical University in Kosice, Slovakia (1992).His interests are in programming systems, including program synthesis and analysis, dynamic compilation, language design, and programming tools. He currently leads two projects: programming by sketching, which explores how to make software synthesis available to programmers while taking advantage of recent advances in decision procedures; and the parallel web browser, which parallelizes the web browser and its scripting to improve browser performance on low-power devices. Previously, he has worked on path-sensitive program analysis, dynamic program analysis, performance understanding and software mining.Ras Bodik is a recipient of several teaching awards. He is working on a new undergraduate course on programming languages and compiler construction; the course tries to teach program translation technology to students who will use it in their software engineering practice.
