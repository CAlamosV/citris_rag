Seed Professor Emeritus Contact seed@ce.berkeley.edu Summary Research In The News Professor Seed's research activities span a wide range of subject areas. His research has had a significant impact on geotechnical practice in a number of areas including: analysis of compaction-induced stresses and deformations, seismic stability analysis of dams and embankments, analysis of soil liquefaction potential and post-liquefaction behavior, analysis of reinforced soil systems and deep braced excavations, mitigation of membrane compliance effects in undrained testing of coarse granular soils, effects of site conditions on seismic site response, finite element analysis of soil-structure interaction, stability and performance evaluation for hazardous waste fills, and others.
