Name: Mark Stacey

Description: My research activity is in the area of environmental fluid mechanics, with a focus on the physical processes that govern fluid motions and the interdisciplinary implications of transport and mixing in estuarine and coastal environments.Ongoing research in my group emphasizes transport and mixing in stratified coastal flows. Specific examples include estuarine sediment transport and the implications for marsh restoration, the dispersion of rafts of vegetation in tidal flows, the dynamics of coastal lagoons, chemical plume dynamics and odorant detection, transport and mixing in thin layers of biological productivity in the coastal ocean, and the connection between small coastal watersheds and the near coastal ocean.The Environmental Fluid Mechanics at Berkeley page provides more detail about research projects in my group and in those of my colleagues. The broader campus community in fluid mechanics can be found on the Fluid Mechanics at Berkeley page.

Stacey’s research and teaching focus on environmental fluid mechanics, with an emphasis on estuaries and the coastal oceans. In the past decade, his research has expanded into the physics of sea level rise in tidal estuaries, including interactions with human infrastructure and the resilience of communities along estuarine shorelines. He also received the prestigious National Science Foundation CAREER award and the Fofonoff Award from the American Meteorological Society. Education Ph.D., Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, 1996 M.S., Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University, 1993 B.A.S., Physics and Political Science, Stanford University, 1991 Stacey’s research focuses on examining the impacts of climate change on coastal communities and systems. He uses numerical modeling, field observations, and theoretical analyses to examine how sea-level rise and changes to precipitation, winds, and storms will impact coastal infrastructure, ecosystems, and the people who live and work in those regions. Specific examples include modeling the feedbacks between shoreline alteration, environmental physical processes, and climate change, and the survival and function of marshes as shoreline features. A motivating goal for Stacey’s research is to contribute to the creation of viable adaptation pathways for coastal communities that integrate community perspectives and knowledge and accurately reflect regional and cross-disciplinary interdependencies.
