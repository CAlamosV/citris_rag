Name: Dominic Massaro

Description: My goal in teaching is to instill in students a sense of wonder about mind and behavior and how questions can be tackled using critical thinking and scientific principles. To impress upon students and peers the fallacies that so easily entrap us, I created a Survey of Psychological Literacy that reveals these entrapments. Several of my courses and my scholarship activities are aimed at not only revealing these entrapments but also providing strategies of critical thinking to overcome them.
