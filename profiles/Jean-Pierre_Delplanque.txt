Name: Jean-Pierre Delplanque

Description: His research efforts center on the multiscale modeling and numerical simulation of complex processes and systems. Applications are interdisciplinary in nature, crossing the boundaries between Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Materials Science. Examples of specific projects range from the strain-assisted microstructural development of polycrystalline materials to the dynamics and condensation of exhaled aerosols.Education:Ph.D. (1993)Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering,University of California, IrvineM.Sc.
