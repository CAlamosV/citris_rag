Personal Website Text Short: Applied Optics - UC Santa Cruz Welcome to the Applied Optics Group at UC Santa Cruz. The main research theme in our group is single particle optics. We develop new, highly sensitive methods to study single particles with optical methods. We use these and other established techniques to gain new understanding of these particles and light-matter interactions in general.  Due to the versatility of optical methods, we can investigate different types of particles. Our current focus areas are: • single biomolecules (Integrated Optofluidics) • single nanomagnets (Nano-magneto-optics) • single photons (Atomic spectroscopy on a chip) We are affiliated with the California Institiute for Quantitative Biomedical Research ( QB3 ), the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering ( CBSE ), and the Storage Systems Research Center ( SSRC ). Professor Schmidt directs the W.M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics whose mission is to incorporate nanoscale features in optofluidic devices to enable new studies of bioparticles and biological processes.
