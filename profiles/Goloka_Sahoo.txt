Name: Goloka Sahoo

Description: Golokaâ€™s interests include hydrodynamic, hydraulic and ecological modeling of environmental processes in lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. He uses multi-dimensional process-based numerical models to provide information for Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) establishment and water budget planning. His hydrologic modeling incorporates artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, and distributed physical models. His work demonstrates the effect of climate change on aquatic systems, hypolimnetic oxygenation and mixing of stratified lakes and reservoirs.
