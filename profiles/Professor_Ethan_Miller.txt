Name: Professor Ethan Miller

Description: Professor Ethan Miller is a Professor of Computer Science in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, and is the Associate Director of the Storage Systems Research Center. He was a member of the RAID project at UC Berkeley, where he did his PhD on a decentralized parallel file system for high-end scientific computing. His current research interests include petabyte-scale file systems, archival storage systems and file systems and scalable view-based metadata management for storage-class memories. He is particularly interested in issues in file and storage system reliability, scalability, and security, both for short-term and archival storage.

            UC Santa Cruz on July 1, 2023. Please read this blog post for details.
        Since I am an emeritus faculty member, I don't have regular teaching duties or service duties.
        My plan is to continue my research collaborations with colleagues, including those in the Storage Systems Research Center .
        I don't plan to take on any new students as a primary advisor.
        However, I will consider co-advising students who want to study
        in specific research areas: secure file systems and data storage,
        archival storage and operating systems for non-volatile memories.
        If you have an interest in either of these areas and an outstanding
        strong background in computer systems, I'd be happy to consider co-advising you in a Ph.D. in those areas. I'm the Director Emeritus of the NSF I/UCRC Center for Research in Storage Systems (CRSS) and the Associate Director of the Storage Systems Research Center here at UC Santa Cruz, where I explore issues in file and storage systems and, more generally,
        distributed systems and operating systems.  My current projects
        include file systems
        for next-generation storage technologies , archival
        storage systems , file system security , scalable file system indexing ,
        and exascale storage systems .
        I'm also interested in storage system benchmarks, algorithms to more efficiently
        manage storage, and information retrieval from very large text and multimedia
        corpora as well as other problems in computer systems and security. I was named an ACM
        Distinguished Scientist in 2013, and an IEEE Fellow in 2014.
        My Erdös number is 3. Contacting me The best way to contact me is via e-mail (see address above).  However, I only
        read email once or twice per day, so if you need a fast response to
        a short message, please use instant messaging.  Voicemail messages aren't a
        good way to reach me, since I rarely check voicemail. If you want to meet me
          in person or arrange a phone call, please contact our group's admin, Cynthia McCarley ,
        to set up a meeting time. Last updated
