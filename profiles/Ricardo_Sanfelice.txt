Name: Ricardo Sanfelice

Description: Ricardo Sanfelice is a professor and chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After academic stops at UC Santa Barbara, MIT, École de Mines de Paris and the University of Arizona, he joined the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz in 2014, where he leads theHybrid Systems Lab. His research focus is on automation and control for systems with nonlinear hybrid dynamics, cyber-physical systems, and feedback systems emerging in robotics, aerospace, power systems and biology.Sanfelice has published nearly 300 peer-reviewedarticlesin journals, conferences and book collections, in addition to the booksHybrid Dynamical SystemsandHybrid Feedback Controlpublished by Princeton University Press. He also holds a U.S. patent onrobust power conversion. He is the recipient of the 2013 SIAM Control and Systems Theory Prize, a National Science Foundation CAREER award, an Air Force Young Investigator Research Award, the 2010 IEEE Control Systems Magazine Outstanding Paper Award, the 2012 STAR Higher Education Award for his contributions to STEM education, and the 2020 ACM Test-of-Time Award from the Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control Conference. Currently he is director of theCyber-Physical Systems Research Centerand associate editor for Automatica, an Elsevier journal. He has served as chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Hybrid Systems. He is a fellow of the IEEE.
