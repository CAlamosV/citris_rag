Name: Carolynn Patten

Description: Carolynn Patten is a neuroscientist and physical therapist who specializes in assessment and treatment of motor dysfunction associated with aging and adult neuropathologies, such as stroke. She directs the UC Davis Biomechanics, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Neuroscience (BRaIN) Lab and co-leads the UC Davis Center for Neuroengineering and Medicine.Patten’s research focuses on understanding the neural basis of human movement, investigating human motor control and learning from a perspective of neuromechanics. Using concurrent behavioral and neurophysiological methods, her laboratory has developed assays sensitive to motor impairment. An emphasis of the lab’s current work is identification of biomarkers to predict motor recovery following stroke and the critical factors that contribute to rehabilitation efficacy. To achieve these goals, projects in the BRaIN Lab investigate neural mechanisms and biomechanical consequences of central nervous system (CNS) pathologies causing motor dysfunction; novel means to induce neuroplasticity and motor recovery; and individual differences in both the natural history of motor recovery and response to rehabilitation interventions.Building on this background, current work supported by CITRIS uses noninvasive and wearable technologies that enable continuous motion sensing to develop data analytic algorithms to identify critical thresholds of motor function and physiologic capacity in older adults living independently in the community.Research interests:biomarkers, neuromechanics, human performance, signal processing, gait, rehabilitation, motor control

She directs the UC Davis Biomechanics, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Neuroscience (BRaIN) Lab and Co-Leads the UC Davis Center for Neuro Engineering and Medicine. Research/Academic Interests Dr. Patten's research focuses on understanding the neural basis of human movement with overriding goals of elucidating mechanisms of movement dysfunction with aging and in adult neuropathologies; determining capacity for motor recovery following central nervous system injury; and identifying critical factors that contribute to rehabilitation efficacy. To achieve these goals, her research program investigates neural mechanisms and biomechanical consequences of CNS pathologies causing motor dysfunction; development of biomarkers of motor recovery; and novel means to induce neuroplasticity and recovery. This translational neuroscience research combines expertise in neurophysiological (i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), EEG, EMG, motor unit recordings, reflex probes), neuroimaging, biomechanical (measures of force production, kinetics), behavioral (kinematics), and clinical approaches to study human performance, and as a result, crosses disciplines of motor control, neuroscience, biomechanics, clinical medicine, rehabilitation, and bioengineering. From a practical standpoint, Dr. Patten's research influences clinical care in neurorehabilitation and therefore helps individuals with motor dysfunction resulting from neuropathologies, such as stroke, maximize recovery, restore activity participation, and optimize quality of life.
