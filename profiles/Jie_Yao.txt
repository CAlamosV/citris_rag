Name: Jie Yao

Description: Prof. Jie Yao obtained his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 2010 and conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford University after that. He joined the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor in 2013. His research interests are  focused on optical materials for nanophotonic applications, including optical sensors, communication devices, etc. Recently he is also developing new material platforms for low-power optoelectronic devices that are essential to future sustainable infrastructures and biomedical applications. Prof. Yao has won the CAREER award from the National Science Foundation and Early Career award from SPIE. He is also a recipient of the Hellman Fellowship from the Hellman Foundation and Bakar Fellowship from the Bakar Fellow program at UC Berkeley.
