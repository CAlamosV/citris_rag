Name: David Levine

Description: David I. Levine is the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.  He is past chair of the University’s Center for Health Research, of the Advisory Board for Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), and of the Haas School’s Economic Analysis and Policy Group.Dr. Levine’s work has emphasized organizational learning (and failures to learn).  Several books examine causes and effects of public and private policies to promote organizational learning in large organizations:Reinventing the Workplace(Brookings, 1995) andThe American Workplace: Skills, Pay and Employee Involvement(Cambridge University Press, 1999).  Other work has examined means to promote continuous improvement in public policies (seeWorking in the Twenty-First Century:Government Policies to Promote Opportunity, Learning and Productivity in the New Economy, M.E. Sharpe, 1998).In recent years much of Dr. Levine’s research has shifted understanding and overcoming barriers to improving health in poor nations.  This research has examined both how to increase demand for health-promoting goods such as safer cookstoves and water filters, and how to change health-related behaviors such as handwashing with soap.Levine was an undergraduate at Berkeley and has taught at the Haas School since receiving his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1987. Levine has also had visiting positions at the Sloan School of Management at MIT, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the President’s Council of Economic Advisers.
