                RISC-V verification. Past projects with Thread Level Speculation, infrared thermal measurements and power
                modeling, and design effort metrics/models. Looking for good MS/PhD students. We have many projects to help, contact me if you are looking for a MS/PhD thesis. Funding MS/PhD Students I have funding opportunities for UCSC PhD and MS students working on
        more productive hardware design flows. Check the current list of
        projects available for MS students at projects.md . Contact me if you are interested. Besides hardware productivity, I am also looking for motivated PhD in other areas in computer architecture. The MASC group is part of UC Santa Cruz Hardware Systems Collective . The
        collective is a group of researchers at the Computer Science Department investigating how to
        design/build/architect/secure/optimize/integrate/program the next generation of hardware.
