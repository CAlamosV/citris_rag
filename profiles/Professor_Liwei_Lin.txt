Name: Professor Liwei Lin

Description: Professor Liwei Lin currently serves as Chancellor’s Professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and Co-Director of the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center.Professor Lin received his B.S. (1986) in Power Mechanical Engineering from the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, and then received his M.S. (1991) and Ph.D. (1993) degrees from UC Berkeley in Mechanical Engineering. After graduation, Professor Lin held the position of senior research scientist at BEI Electronics Inc. He also served as associate professor at the National Taiwan University and assistant professor at the University of Michigan before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley in 1999. Professor Lin also held the position of vice chair of graduate study within the mechanical engineering department from 2006-2009.Professor Lin’s research interests and activities at UC Berkeley include MEMS, NEMS, Nanotechnology, design and manufacturing of microsensors and microactuators, development of micromachining processes by silicon surface/bulk micromachining, micro moulding process, and mechanical issues in MEMS such as heat transfer, solid/fluid mechanics and dynamics. Professor Lin is the co-inventor listed on 14 patents in MEMS and has authored or co-authored 90 journal publications and more than 130 refereed conference proceedings. Since 1996 he has graduated 17 Ph.D. and 25 M.S. students.Research InterestsMEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems); NEMS (Nanoelectromechanical Systems); Nanotechnology; design and manufacturing of microsensors and microactuators; development of micromachining processes by silicon surface/bulk micromachining; micro moulding process; mechanical issues in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) including heat transfer, solid/fluid mechanics and dynamics.
