Description: Title:Associate ProfessorEmail:kmccloskey@ucmerced.eduPhone:(209) 228-7885Website:ResearchEducation:Ph.D., 2001 — Ohio State University & Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Joint)M.S., 1999 — Chemical Engineering, Ohio State UniversityB.S., 1996 — Chemical Engineering, Ohio State UniversityResearch Interests:Tissue engineering is a sub/cross-discipline that focuses on the design, development, and maintenance of tissue products that are used for repairing, improving, or restoring tissue function. This field is still in its infancy, and many problems and challenges exist that have yet to be overcome before safe, high-quality engineered tissue products are available in the marketplace. Therefore, my research focuses on:Deriving and characterizing pure populations from stem cells in vitroComparing the function of such cells with mature cells derived in vivoUsing these cells towards regenerative medicine applicationsTissue engineering and cell therapy approachesCardiovascular cell lineage, but plan to expand into other cell systems long-term
